What’s different about your desktop and phone layout?

- The phone is smaller in size compared to the wider screen of a desktop.

Which UI/HUD elements did you move, hide, or resize? Why?

- The retry and continue buttons we had to resize and change where they were in the screen to make it viable for a finger to press.

What did you notice about designing for real screen sizes?

- Accounting for blank space was one of the hardest parts to solve.

How would a player’s experience change between the two versions?

- Notes would become smaller from a phone compared to a desktop.  
- Tapping on a screen is not the same as tapping keys on a keyboard.  
- While tapping the screen, the fingers or hands could get in the way of visibility of the notes or bullets coming from the top of the screen.
